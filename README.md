# UWC 2.0 - Random
## Introduction
UWC 2.0 is an information management system for urban waste management in HCMC. It is developed by Organization X for Service provider Y to improve the efficiency of garbage collection. The system has a Task Management module that allows back officers, collectors and janitors to coordinate waste collection tasks. The system uses ReactJS as the main framework for creating a web-based user interface, a relational database and external APIs for data from Major Collecting Points (MCPs). The system is expected to handle real-time data from at least 1000 MCPs at the moment and 10.000 MCPs in five years. The system interfaces are in Vietnamese, with an opportunity to switch to English in the future.
